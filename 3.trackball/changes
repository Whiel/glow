The new thing is the camera.
If you run the program, you'll be able to rotate the camera respect the origin
with clic+drag or move the camera around with right-clic+drag.

To do handle the rotation I am using a trackball. The code for it is in common/trackball.
The code I've sent you before is not correct, dont rely on it! I fixed this one.

The translation is handled in the main file.

Also, I created a new structure to hold the state of the renderer, called scene_state.
The structure holds information about the camera, the window, the mouse...
An instance of this structure is bound to the window using glfwSetWindowUserPointer.
This makes the structure acessible by all event handlers without being global. Also
it is bound to the window, so another window could use the same event handlers and
a different state structure, and they would not interfere with each other.

I have only added the structure, event handlers and some lines in the function main(),
the shaders are the same.
